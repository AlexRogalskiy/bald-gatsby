<h6 style="padding:0;">
  Within 5 years since its inception as a local startup, Homepoint has become
  the third largest wholesale mortgage company in the nation. To support its
  continued growth and the stealth IPO efforts, Homepoint decided to refresh its
  brand presence and communication strategy.

By the time I joined, external agencies had already been working on significant chunks of visual branding and marketing website projects. As a design director, I became responsible for further finalizing the identity development, creating a compelling verbal and visual brand narrative, and continously collaborating with all areas of the company—_product, engineering, marketing, legal, analytics, real estate, and more_—to keep improving the brand experience for customers.

Based on the wordmark proposed by the agency, we tweaked small details and created a series of mark variations for parent and sister companies as well as a variety of digital applications.

### Color palette

To highlight its energetic and approachable personality, we crafted a palette of vivid hues in high saturation. Also, each hue provides 10 levels of lightness tints to ensure proper contrast in any combination.
