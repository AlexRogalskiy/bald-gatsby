## From one dot to another

It’s that time of the year. I’m sure you’ll receive a lot of greeting cards but here’s mine anyways, with a minute-long video I made last night. I’ll be brief.

Spending time with family in Seoul—mostly doing mundane things together—I got to think a lot about people around me and how blessed I am to be connected with them. With You.

  One dot represents a position. Two dots represent a relationship.

One dot represents a position. Two dots represent a relationship.

Thank you for being there as who you are. Be it employment, friendship, family or whatever we name it, I’m grateful for our connection. It’s what makes me more than just a floating dot. I hope to be a meaningful dot in yours as well.

Have a wonderful new year, and please don’t be a stranger.

Sincerely,
B.
