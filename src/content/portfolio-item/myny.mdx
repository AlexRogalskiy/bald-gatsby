### background

After I had spent the first five years in New York, I realized my entire life shapeshifted in practically all aspects, both personally and professionally. Looking at my old and new passport photos side by side&mdash;_a clean-shaven academic with nerdy haircut versus a bearded bald designer_&mdash;inspiration kicked in to create a visual quinquennial report that outlines my life before and after New York.
