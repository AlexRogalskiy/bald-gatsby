### Challenge

Going through a name change from _Young &amp; Rubicam Brands_ to _Young &amp; Rubicam Group_, the firm needed a new visual identity system developed. A holding company consisting of top-notch agencies in premium marketing and communications services, they hoped to better signal the unified platform for the partner companies without overpowering individual brand visual identities.

### Solution

Under the main creative direction—_the use of ampersand to communicate collectivity and multi-color palette to celebrate the variety_—I first developed the color scheme in collaboration with Landor Associates. Once the logotype and ampersand graphic established, I worked closely with Global Brand Officer to create a series of real-life applications: from stationery sets to corporate events, to interactive web apps, and to interior/exterior signage systems. The overarching visual concept was the multiplicity of ampersands in vibrant colors to communicate _a wide range of expertise in unison_
