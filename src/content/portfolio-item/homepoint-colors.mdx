## Identity Colors

The identity-defining colors of Homepoint brand. Since they are core part of brand identity, one should not create a lighter or darker tint out of them.

## Support Colors

A complementary set of colors for visual accents and contrast. Each swatch can be used in ten different lightness with `500` being the standard primary tint of each hue. Warm hues are mostly reserved for charts, graphs, and otherwise UI distinctions,

Every support color swatch can be used in ten different lightness, each marked by a unique number: `50` being the lightest and `900` the darkest. Developed primarily for UI/UX needs, this system enables a wide variety of color combinations while ensuring proper contrast for accessbility and maintaining consistency.
