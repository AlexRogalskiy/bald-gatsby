### Challenge

<div>

The company was about to launch complete rebranding and go public on <small>NASDAQ</small>, and the old <small>.NET </small>site had desperately needed a clean-up. Some of the top priorities were:

<br />

- Organize the content in a more sensible and intuitive structure for users

- Provide a faster, more flexible workflow for marketing team

- Build a more reliable way of auditing compliance content for legal team

- Make it seamless and painless to further expand front-end functionality without worrying about <small>CMS</small> backend

</div>

### Solution

Partnering with Zeek Interactive as the development agency, we decided to rearchitect the entire site on a frontend-first stack. Initially Gatsby on Gatsby Cloud was considered, but later switched to Next.js due to build time concerns. The end result is a fully responsive, super-fast, Jamstack website which users and stakeholders are excited alike.

- Outlined site sitemap and wireframed each area

- Directed the content team for writing and editing

- Collaborated with Zeek in writing front-end

- Post-launch, continuing to refactor and expand the code base
