### Challenge

Build a identity design system that captures the essence of multi-dimensionality

### Solution

The immediate goal was two-fold: 1) to create a visual identity system with cross-platform versatility, and 2) to develop an online platform as a professional hub. As for point #1, I conceptualized around minimal geometry that can construct from simplest shapes to the most complicated fractal structures, which connotes my professional versatility. Once I designed a logotype out of basic geometry, a vibrant color palette and motion elements were applied. To translate the motion and flexibility to print, I created a series of abstract patterns using the same geometric element and printed on the back of business cards.
